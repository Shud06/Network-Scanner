# Network-Scanner

This is a Python-based network scanner that can:

1. Discover active devices on a network:** Perform ARP scanning to identify IP addresses and MAC addresses of devices.
2. Scan ports on target devices:**  Perform port scanning to find open ports and identify services running on them.
3. Attempt OS detection:** Use Nmap and p0f to try to identify the operating systems of target devices.
4. Visualize network topology:** Create a 2D graph representation of network connections.
